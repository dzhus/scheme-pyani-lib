* About this package
  This package provides some Scheme libraries of various flavor. It
  originates from some code I wanted to share across several of my
  programs.
** Naming
   The collection is named `pyani-lib`. The name is so gay because I
   don't suppose that anyone else will use this lib and it's quite ok
   to me.

** Features
   Notice: in January 2009 I discovered [[http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=simple-matrix.plt&owner=wmfarr][simple-matrix]] package, which
   provided superior implementation for most of facilities `pyani-lib`
   had, so I decided to remove most of existing code.
*** Some useful functions for matrices and vectors
    Simple vector and matrix norms are available.
*** Procedures for functions
    Derivatives (usual and partial), gradient and Hessian matrix
    procedures are available under `pyani-lib/function-ops`.
* Installation
  Invoking `make` in top-level directory will build a package with
  `.plt` extension. It may installed with `make install` or manually
  using `setup-plt(1)`.
* Using library
  You'll want to use the following modules under `pyani-lib`
  collection: `function-ops`, `vector`, `matrix`.
* To be done
** IN PROGRESS Use contracts
   Contracts good, bugs bad.
   
** TODO Strip tests out of .plt archive
